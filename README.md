# Air_Quality_Prediction
Project for Froyo Technologies

1. Introduction
Purpose of the System:
The Air Quality Analysis system is being developed to analyze and interpret hourly measurements from an array of chemical sensors deployed in a polluted Italian city. The system will clean, prepare, and explore the dataset, generate visualizations, and provide predictive insights for key pollutants. This helps policymakers, researchers, and environmental agencies understand air quality trends and make informed decisions.
Objectives:
•	Clean and preprocess the Air Quality UCI dataset.
•	Explore and visualize pollutant trends and distributions.
•	Perform regression analysis to predict pollutant levels from meteorological variables.
•	Provide actionable insights and recommendations for air quality management.

2. Goals:
•	Data cleaning and preprocessing.
•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
•	Regression modeling for pollutant prediction.
